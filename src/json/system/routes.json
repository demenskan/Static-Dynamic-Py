    //the routes file tells the script how to handle the request strings. Each request string will be splitted
    //in parts according to the slash character (/) giving place to 2 parts named 'selector' & 'arguments'.
    // the selector part must match with some of the elements within this file. It can have as many 'subfolders'
    // as you want, but keep in mind that the more levels you use, the slower the script will get.
    // Each element can have the following properties:
    //  * instructor  -> (mandatory) tells which instructor file will be used.
    //  * arguments -> (optional) the extra data that will help the instructor how to behave. Each argument
    //                 will be separated by a slash. If by chance you may accept slashes inside an argument,
    //                 try escaping it by using '%2F' entity instead
