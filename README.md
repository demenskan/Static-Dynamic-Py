StatDynPy - Static Dynamic Python

Static websites created with JSON content and HTML templates

Do you have a static website with several pages, but do you want to change it looks as you please?
or maybe do you want to store a low traffic website on the cloud and you want it to be as cheap as possible?

StatDynPy is a tool that can run either as a container or as a serverless function that can take HTTP requests, read content files and templates  from a cloud storage and present them as a static website. It's all JSON configured too, so it's simple to use.

If you aren't fond of reading too much, you can learn how to use it by checking the examples [here]. Otherwise you can check up the documentation [here]
